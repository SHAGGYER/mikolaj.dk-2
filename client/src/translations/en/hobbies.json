  "hobby1_text": "I began training in a gym when I was 15 years old. I trained regularly for a year, and I got some muscle mass, but nothing extraordinary. I had always been very thin, and it helped with getting some muscles in my body. I know quite a bit about theory and techniques. Right now I train with resistance bands at home.",
  "hobby2": "Soccer",
  "hobby2_text1": "I played soccer a lot when I was little. Every day I met up with friends and we played on a pitch made of sand. The goals didn't have nets, it was because the town was very poor. I also played a lot of FIFA with first being 97. The one I played most was FIFA 2003, and my computer almost couldn't run it at all.",
  "hobby2_text2": "These days I mostly watch soccer on TV or on the Internet. I mostly watch some highlights on Facebook or if my favorite team, Real Madrid, makes a new video on YouTube.",
  "hobby3": "World of Warcraft",
  "hobby3_text": "I fell in love with the game in 2007 when I was 16 years old, so long time ago. It was through a South Park parody that I got interested in it, and then I thought I would try the game. The company behind World of Warcraft, Blizzard, makes expansions until today and millions of players are playing it. To be honest I like to play in order to get to higher levels, rather than playing at maximum level and enjoying the end-game content, because I like the feeling of adventure leveling gives me."
